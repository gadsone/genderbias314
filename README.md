Abstract 
Gender bias is “[the] differential experiences related to classroom participation, socialization of behavior, textbook content, and more” based on genders (Center for Mental Health in Schools, 2014).  Gender inequity in the classroom is overlooked in the classroom and that is mostly because the bias comes from the educators.  Therefore, we conduct this survey to get people thinking more about this issue that affects many schools internationally. We have experienced gender bias in the classrooms from other classmates which sparked our interest in making everyone aware. 

Essentially, we are detecting to see if there is any bias in USG classrooms. Using one-sample t-tests we are testing whether classmates’ sharing answers depends on a particular major. Also, if the existence of gender bias in the classrooms affects students’ GPA. And, if classmates of a particular race/ethnicity interact more with people of the same gender. Using one-proportion z-test, we are testing to see if females are more perceptive of gender bias than males.

Project Description
Our project is on gender bias in and outside of classrooms. The project is compelling because we will administer the survey at USG. We first thought of this idea when our all-female group presented to a class about an app and we felt our ideas were not validated. We would like to explore if people are consciously thinking about how gender affects classroom dynamics and other areas in life. This project is important because we are going to include students at USG in different programs to see if gender bias exist and if they experienced it The campus can use this study to engage their students as to why this happening-if it happening (should they address this?) Every student should be treated equally and with respect. Our audience for this project is going to be the student and staff faculty USG, but only students will be allowed to participate.

Data Collection
This project is an observational study. We made a survey on Google Form. We surveyed current students at USG based on questions on the google form. Stratified sampling method will be used since we are surveying a subset of the student population from all 9 universities at Shady Grove. Also, the population we are surveying have more than one or more thing in common. To ensure the stratified sampling will be random and representative of USG, we will ask on the anonymous google forms what their majors and home institution (9 Maryland universities) degree level, and gender. Although our optimal sample size is 254 given a 90% level of confidence and 5% margin of error, we were only able to collect 66 responses.

Hypotheses/Research Questions


Research Question
Methodology (Statistical Test) Selected to Answer Question
RQ 1
Does classmate’s sharing answers based on their gender impact students of a particular major?
One-sample t-test 
RQ 2
Are females more perceptive of gender bias than males?
One-proportion z test 
RQ 3
Does the existence of gender bias affect a student’s GPA?
One-sample t-test 
RQ 4
Do classmates of a particular race/ethnicity interact more with people of the same gender?
One-sample t-test 


Hypothesis
1: There is a positive correlation between students of a particular major and if these students share information based on their gender. We predict that its influence will be statistically insignificant. 

2: There is a negative correlation between females and whether or not they are aware gender bias exists. We predict that its influence will be statistically significant. 

3: There is a negative correlation between if a student believes that gender bias exists at USG and a student’s GPA. We predict that its influence will be statistically significant. 

4: There is a positive correlation between a particular race/ethnicity and if they interact most with people of the same gender. We predict that its influence will be statistically insignificant.

Methodology
What statistical test(s) did you employ? Explain how each statistical test was employed and what the results were.

RQ1: Does classmate’s sharing answers based on their gender impact students of a particular major? 
	We used a one-sample t-test because we wanted to compare the means for the individual majors to themselves. Mu was set at 3 because we assumed that generally, the average student would say that they sometimes receive help and information that was relevant to their classes. There were not enough participants in the survey from each major, so our results were not significant.

RQ2: Are females more perceptive of gender bias than males?
	We used one-proportion z test because we wanted to determine whether the hypothesized proportion differs from the survey, and males were our base case. We did not have a large enough sample to get a statistically significant result.

RQ3: There is a negative correlation between if a student believes that gender bias exists at USG and a student’s GPA.
	Our base case here was students who don’t believe that gender bias exists at USG, and we used a one-sample t-test. Our results were, again, not statistically significant because we did not have enough respondents.

RQ4: There is a positive correlation between a particular race/ethnicity and if they interact most with people of the same gender.
	We used a one-sample t-test here as well. We tested each ethnicity by themselves against a mu of 3 (assuming that 3 would be a normal mean for a normal distribution), because we wanted to see if there would be a significant result amongst any of the ethnicities, and then we could subsequently compare means. Results were inconclusive due to the low amount of people who took the survey.

Results
	Although our tests proved to be not statistically significant, that was due to multiple factors. This study has taught us that to set up a survey, we need more time to both works on the questions and to spread the survey. Our questions were not really answered, due to too small of a data set, but overall it appeared to show that certain majors were less prone to gender bias (social work and nursing, because they are female dominated majors according to the respondents). We plan to rework the survey to have more clear questions as well as more examples in the future, and release the survey when students are not crunching for exams and more hesitant to take the survey.
-------------

Conclusion
One challenge we faced in planning and conducting the study was getting over 250 students to partake in our survey. If we had enough time, we could have collected about 255 responses and gotten a more representative and widespread dataset. Another challenge we faced was how we worded some of our survey questions. Going into the study, we did not think it would confuse so many of our respondents. Lastly, a challenge we faced during the planning of our study was figuring out what tests matched with specific hypotheses. 

Overall, the study has taught us to create a clearer picture for our respondents in order to get the desired results. We know gender inequity exists in the classrooms, but it was just difficult narrowing down concrete examples of them to where the respondents would understand. Also, the study has taught us how difficult this whole process is. From getting the responses to cleaning the data to entering it into R, this was definitely a challenge/experience we will not forget.
